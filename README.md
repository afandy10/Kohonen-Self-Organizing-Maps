# Kohonen-Self-Organizing-Maps
- Implementation of one of the ANN algorithms for Unsupervised Learning, in this case it is clustering
- I use python programming language and write the algorithm as simple as possible without use clustering moduls
- I also use classification Iris data set for compared with this clustering algorithm, analyze and visualize it to show the different result.
